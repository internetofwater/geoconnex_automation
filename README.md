# geoconnex_automation
A repository to automate PID management for Geoconnex.us

## Epic

As a [geoconnex.us PID registry](https://geoconnex.internetofwater.dev) admin, I want the act of merging a pull request committing lists of 1:1 mappings or .xml files of regex mappings to the [geoconnex.us](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us) repository to automatically initiate POST PID imports, updates, and retires, so that I don't have to do anything else to manage PIDs other than interacting with the repository.
